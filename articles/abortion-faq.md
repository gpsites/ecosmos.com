### People know the consequences of sex, so the woman is choosing to make a fertilized egg dependent on her. Doesn't that introduce an obligation from CONCEPTION to independence and eliminate reproductive rights?

No. Merely having something dependent on you is not what's essential here --- you have no obligation
to a tapeworm that you dependent on you, for example. And being *responsible* for the dependence
doesn't itself create an obligation, either: my choosing to take a puppy home from the pet store
leaves it dependent on me, yet that can't create any (proper) legal obligation to it because a
puppy is not the sort of thing that can have rights. (Of course, neglecting or abusing one's puppy
would be a vivid and shocking sign of horrid character that we must not turn a blind eye to, but
dealing with someone's immorality in general is different than how we must respond to their
violations of rights in particular --- please see the question on recklessness, below.) The key
here is that bringing about another *person's* vital dependence on you creates an obligation on you
to deliver him from that dependence because failing to do so would be a violation of the rights
that he and every *person* has.

Recall that in the case of pregnancy, a fertilized egg is a *potential* human being, which in
several months could reach the developmental stage of being an *actual* human being. Potential
human beings aren't actual human beings and can have no rights, any more than tapeworms and puppies
and rocks --- so there can be no legitimate legal obligations to them. Actual human beings have
rights, so it is possible to have obligations to them. In choosing to let her pregnancy proceed to
the point of personhood, the mother is bringing a person *into* a state of vital dependence on
her --- and so she has adopted an obligation to deliver that person *from* that dependence on her.

### Don't late-term threats to the health of mothers invalidate your account?

A while back, [this challenge](http://dianahsieh.com/blog/2008/06/rights-and-abortion.shtml) to a
standard of personhood like the one I argue for was put forth for discussion:

> The problem with [such a standard for personhood] comes when a late-stage pregnancy endangers the
> life of the mother. Let's imagine that the pregnant woman must end the pregnancy somehow or she
> will die. If she aborts, she has a 5% risk of serious complication. That's because the doctor can
> kill and dismember the fetus in the womb, then extract it. (Sorry, that's icky.) However, if she
> attempts to give birth to the fetus, she has a 15% risk of serious complication, with a 5% risk
> of death. (Such cases do happen. In general, a live birth will always involve greater risk of
> complications than a late-term abortion.)

> If a fetus has rights at [a point like the one you are advocating], then either (1) the woman
> must be obliged to suffer any risk of death --- perhaps 99% --- in order to respect the rights of
> the fetus within her or (2) the state must arbitrarily draw a line somewhere specifying the
> acceptable risk to her life for the sake of a live birth. The first option is morally monstrous:
> you're sacrificing a person with an actual life to a fetus with merely a potential life to lead.
> The second isn't any more appealing because some arbitrary amount of risk is deemed obligatory
> for the woman to assume. In either case, women will be forced to die for the sake of the fetus.
> The only question is whether it's more women dying or less women dying.

> After some unhappy thought about such cases, I decided that the only clear and bright

> lives and health for the sake of a fetus --- was to accept that rights begin after the fetus has
> left the womb.

Unfortunately, this only begs the question. Rather than helping us figure out whether a fetus
should ever be considered a person, it *assumes* that a fetus cannot be a person: the argument has
rhetorical force precisely (and only) because a *person* having to suffer any such risk for
a *non-person* is indeed patently ridiculous, horrible, sacrificial. Contrast this with the same
kind of thing, but where such an assumption won't be smuggled in: firefighters also face risks in
rescuing people, even more frequently mortal and with daunting odds. But notice how we don't accept
the challenges arising from that as an argument against firefighters nonetheless being responsible
in general to rescue their clients.

There is substantial risk in saving people in fires, and firefighters know it. That's part of being
a firefighter. There is substantial risk in pregnancy, and women know it. That's part of being a
mother. There are significant risks in raising children, too, and parents know it. That's part of
being a parent. In all such cases, they are pursuing their values *by voluntarily taking on a
commitment to someone else that entails personal risks* --- and in all such cases we can, have, and
will continue to develop appropriate legal standards for those challenging circumstances where we
have to draw the tragic line between upholding our chosen commitments to other people vs.
defending our own lives.

So the above is not any argument against (or for) the sensibility of fetal personhood. It is
perhaps a call for clarifying the meaning of significant commitments like those entailed in
pregnancy and child-rearing (and being a first-responder), and for clarifying what counts as
self-defense against one's life being sacrificed in those circumstances.

### What about careless, irresponsible women using abortion for birth control --- isn't that bad?

We can and should judge those around us for their virtues and vices, and if someone is careless and
irresponsible, then they of course should be treated accordingly because practicing justice is
critical to our pursuing successful lives. But the important bit is that without a rights violation
this should be a private affair to be handled by peaceful means like disassociation --- not a
governmental affair to be handled by coercive means like jail. It is a matter of virtue, not a
matter of rights, and these must never be confused.

Suppose you discover Joe told a baldfaced lie to impress you or hide his being a louse --- he is
clearly immoral but has not violated your rights (he hasn't initiated the use of physical force
against you, coercing you to act against your will, like in a holdup or a case of fraud). Your
proper response is to shun him, and to maybe even advertise why you are shunning him if he is nasty
enough to warrant it. It would be wrong to, say, haul off and slug him in retribution --- that
response would be qualitatively *worse* than his "mere" immorality: that would be an initiation of
physical force, a violation of rights. Passing a law to jail liars would be the rights-violating
equivalent of punching Joe in the face for telling a whopper.

In general, any law against "mere" immorality will itself constitute a systematic,
institutionalized violation of rights --- something which turns the entire purpose of government on
its head. That has to be absolutely avoided if we are to have a rights-respecting society (see
my [article on punishment](punishment) for more on this). *A proper government is the guardian of
rights --- not of truth and virtue. In protecting rights, it preserves the conditions required for
the **pursuit** of truth and virtue, of life and happiness.*

### What about someone awakening from a coma to discover they are now seven months pregnant?

This comes up because people naturally project situations, even incredibly rare, where a fetus
could pass the point of personhood without the mother's choice: someone gets pregnant, doesn't know
it yet, and somehow finds herself in a position where she cannot choose her course until it would
be too late to change course.

I think this also points to the best way to think about it: the people around the coma victim
(doctors, relatives) can project that as well, and would be negligent if they didn't take steps to
ensure such a crisis does not emerge. The doctors should recognize the woman is pregnant, and how
long she has been pregnant. If she is several months pregnant and quite unlikely to have missed the
condition, or her relatives report that she was desperately trying to become a mother or she
outright told them she was going to be a mother, or if she has a living will specifying her desire
to be a parent if she were to become pregnant (just the sort of thing a living will is for), then
they should try to accommodate her choice and let the pregnancy continue if possible. But if
instead she entered the coma early in pregnancy and was therefore unlikely to have known about and
chosen to let it proceed --- AND if she is showing no signs of emerging from her coma several
months later --- then they should terminate the pregnancy prior to the point of personhood to avoid
forcing her into such a tremendous commitment.

### What about parents ending up with a permanent dependent --- someone impossible to raise to independence?

This doesn't pertain to the abortion discussion per se, but if the entire purpose of parenthood is
to raise a child to independence, then it is reasonable to wonder about those circumstances where
disease or deformation make it so a child can never possibly achieve independence --- as with, say,
significant mental retardation.

In more primitive times with less developed societies, a permanent parental obligation would often
mean death for the parent. Terrible situations like this didn't invalidate the right to self
defense, so it was natural for various cultures to build up practices for eliminating such a deadly
threat. This was no doubt utterly heartbreaking --- picture cliffs and ice floats. As humankind's
(pockets of) robustness and wealth grew, the opportunity for other means to eliminate this deadly
threat arose, charities for example. This was certainly still heartbreaking --- picture babies left
on the steps of the convent.

As our wealth and scientific knowledge has grown in (relatively) free societies, we've gained the
power to identify and avoid or eliminate many such troubles, making something already uncommon ever
more rare. And charities can more easily form in more advanced free societies with their vastly
greater wealth, absorbing far more of the impact of what would otherwise be a deadly burden. In a
fully free society, where individual rights are respected and defended as absolutes, the growth in
wealth and scientific knowledge would be even more aggressive --- especially as the unnecessary and
unjust burden of those who use the government to violate rights to their advantage would be
eliminated. There is ever growing incentive and means for life-serving capitalist innovations to
emerge and smoothly distribute the remaining shrinking risks and costs, like new insurance
products.

### What about someone discovering that their late-term fetus has a defect and is dying?

Dr. George Tiller was murdered by a Christian anti-abortion activist, and one of the late-term
abortions he performed was featured in [a news
story](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090602/ap_on_re_us/us_tiller_profile) about him. It was
forwarded to me as a Hard Case to consider:

> One woman who turned to him was Miriam Kleiman, of northern Virginia. Nine years ago, a routine
> sonogram revealed her 29-week-old fetus had major brain abnormalities that prevented the baby's
> heart and lungs from functioning properly.

> Doctors told her the baby would die in utero or soon after birth. Kleiman's doctors told her a
> third trimester abortion was not possible.

> Kleiman says she could not bear a two-month death watch. "There was a baby dying inside of me,
> and it wasn't if, but when," she says.

> After desperate pleas, she says, a doctor scribbled Tiller's name on a scrap of paper. She and
> her husband flew to Wichita and drove through a gauntlet of protesters to the fortress-like
> clinic.

> She remembers Tiller and his staff as kind and compassionate. She had the abortion and brought
> home her baby to be buried.

Let's try to move this horrible situation to the boat and see how we think about it there. You've
taken Bob on a ride out to sea, and during the trip he's collapsed into a coma and a doctor on
board says that he is certain to die --- that even if you could get Bob back to shore before he's
ultimately expired, it will make no difference as this condition is terminal. Of course, it will be
incredibly traumatic to have to watch Bob die either way, so why not limit the badness by
euthanizing him now, as humanely as possible? Well, on the boat that would seem shockingly
premature: diagnoses are often wrong, and circumstances can sometimes suddenly shift, allowing new
measures to be taken, and so on. Wanting to avoid watching Bob's long death wouldn't justify
turning it into a short one.

It isn't so uncommon to travel a terminal path with others, often loved ones, and it certainly
takes a toll on us psychologically --- but such a toll is *not* the primary element of a decision
to "pull the plug." There are a lot of complicating factors for properly determining when that is
called for, and this is the sort of circumstance-driven decision where we rightly require due
diligence: Diagnoses and projections can go wrong, so carefully verifying them is called for; then
confirming there is no chance for a shift in circumstances that might let new measures be brought
to bear is needed; etc. I hope that such diligence happened in Ms. Kleiman's case.

The salient point for the abortion discussion is to see that what makes this case hard is not
unique to troubled late-term pregnancies (and so its being difficult to get right is not an
argument against late-term fetal rights). It is just a reminder that life can sometimes be
incredibly challenging.

### Your argument is based on the Objectivist ethics and politics --- does it agree with Ayn Rand's position on abortion?

Ayn Rand and Leonard Peikoff (her top student) are consistently clear on the embryo's lack of
rights in the first trimester of pregnancy, as well as on the absolute requirement of recognizing a
child's rights after birth. But they seem to show ambivalence regarding rights and personhood of
the fetus in the later stages of pregnancy.

Rand held that birth is a critical event, an absolute (1967), that rights are not possible until
that point (1968), that life starts at birth (1971) --- but yet pondered the significance of the
capacity for consciousness before birth (1967) and the medical status of the entity's life at six
to eight months (1971), then qualified its application, saying that abortion at the "last minute"
of a baby or child that is formed is a "different issue" than eliminating a mere potential (1974),
and that one may argue about the later stages of pregnancy (1975). Her last available statement on
the matter (1976) explicitly endorses the Supreme Court's *Roe v. Wade* decision of 1973, which
permits unrestricted abortion through the second trimester while allowing severe restrictions on
abortions in the final trimester.

And Peikoff wrote in his book *Objectivism* that rights cannot belong to fetuses (1991) --- yet
when a student asked him to clarify the actualization of personhood, he discussed a "borderline
area" where this could in fact hold before birth, in fetuses (1992). All of these referenced quotes
are included below for further exploration.

It is of course only speculation, but their (uncharacteristic) cloudiness in this could perhaps
stem from grasping, at least implicitly, certain late-term facts, but also appropriately taking
care to guard against any possible undermining of the fact that people have no unchosen obligations
in a free society and that individual rights are absolutes. An uncompromising recognition of these
basic truths could be threatened by any possibility of an *unchosen* obligation to a developing
fetus, and by any "clash" or need for "balancing", "trading off", or otherwise compromising on
rights between fetus and mother.

[My article](abortion) is essentially an attempt to explore such an account, showing how
recognizing the rights-implications of the late-term facts regarding the nature of the developing
fetus integrates with and therefore poses no threat to the absolutism of rights or to the fact of
there being no unchosen duties. The result is an account of reproductive rights and late-term fetal
rights that also illuminates how parental obligations arise in general (and as a nice bonus, it
indicates what gives rise to the central purpose of parenthood along with a basic standard
circumscribing any state intervention in child-rearing).

In his Advanced Seminars on *Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand*, conducted during and just
after its writing, Peikoff was asked about the point of personhood:
