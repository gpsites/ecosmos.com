The abortion discussion centers on *personhood*, the state of having rights recognized and
respected. This is the focus because legal obligations only arise in the context of rights ---
whether the obligation is to refrain from coercively interfering in another's pursuit of life and
happiness, or to provide goods and services of some kind. In contrast, we can have no (legitimate)
legal obligations to rocks and goldfish precisely because these are not the sorts of things which
can have rights. So clarity on abortion rights and parental obligations requires understanding
personhood as well as understanding the relationship between rights and obligations.

Throughout it is essential that we respect the fact that rights are inalienable absolutes which
cannot come into conflict. Rights are principles identifying fundamental facts arising from the
nature of humans and of the world. As Rand aptly put it, "Rights are conditions of existence
required by man's nature for his proper survival." "A 'right' is a moral principle defining and
sanctioning a man's freedom of action in a social context."<sup>2</sup> Moral principles in general
are absolutes because they identify essential, metaphysically-given facts that must be respected
and accommodated in the pursuit of human life.<sup>3</sup> So there can be no clash and no valid
"compromising," "balancing," or "trading off" of genuine rights --- any more than there can be a
clash or need to compromise between the principles that identify the movement of the falling apple
and the movement of the planet it falls on. A rational account of human rights and abortion will
never posit a conflict between or attempt the incoherence of "balancing" or otherwise compromising
any agent's absolute, inalienable rights.

I will begin by briefly reviewing the commonly proposed criteria for personhood, clearing the field
of distractions. Then I will discuss the relationship of rights and obligations, highlighting a
principle that dispels a certain "inevitable" clash of rights as illusory. Finally I will draw on
elements introduced along the way to present a rational, scientific account of abortion rights and
parental obligations.

### Conception

A great many people contend that "life begins at conception" and that personhood should be
recognized in fertilized human eggs.<sup>4</sup> But it is plainly false that life begins at
conception, as sperm and egg are each alive prior to combining at fertilization. Perhaps they mean
that a *unique* human life begins at conception, as it is true that the fertilized egg is
genetically human, unique, and alive.

However, in itself that is not significant to personhood: A cancerous tumor is genetically unique
and has human DNA, but it is certainly not something which has rights --- in fact, it is the sort
of thing we strive to kill. And on the other hand, twins are *not* composed of genetically unique
human tissue, yet they *are* clearly people with rights that must be recognized and protected. So
being composed of genetically unique human tissue can itself have nothing whatever to do with the
correct criteria for personhood.

But it is significant that a fertilized human egg has the power to become a human being who is
fully formed and developed and a person living independently of its parents. That is, the
fertilized egg is clearly a *potential* human being which, under the right circumstances, will
become an *actual* human being who can be born and continue developing into adulthood.

Of course a potential is just that --- a potential, not an actual. An acorn has the potential to
become an oak tree, under the right circumstances. But a potential tree is not an actual tree:
potential trees offer no shade, cannot be harvested for woodworking projects or bonfires, and so
on. Similarly, a potential human being is not an actual human being: It can offer no love or
conversation. It cannot eat, drink, or be merry. In fact, it is unable to do anything that we
associate with people, in any degree or form. It is not the sort of thing that could need or
exercise rights. So a rational account of rights and abortion will not allow any conflation of
potential human beings with actual people whose rights can and should be recognized and respected.

While the point of fertilization cannot constitute the appearance of personhood, this does raise
the significant question: just when does such a potential become actualized?

### Viability

Viability is often proposed as the answer. It is defined as "potentially able to live outside the
mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid."<sup>5</sup> Viability, its advocates contend, is the
point at which potential people having no rights become actual people with rights.

But notice that viability so construed shifts with advances in technology: It used to be quite near
the point of natural birth. Then the 1970's Supreme Court's landmark *Roe v. Wade* decision noted
that viability was near the beginning of the third trimester. It has been "receding relentlessly"
since then and technological advances could in principle move it all the way to the point of
fertilization with incubator replacing womb entirely.<sup>6</sup> The absurdity of someday defining
a single cell as a person indicates that something is deeply wrong with viability as a criterion.

The trouble stems from losing sight of the fact that our fundamental rights are rooted in and flow
from the metaphysical facts of human nature --- not from anything that might flow from, be defined
in terms of, or depend in any way upon what our technology happens to make possible in any given
era. Rights arise from the kind of things we *are*, not what technology enables for us; they are a
recognition of the essential kinds of actions necessary for us to maintain our existence as humans,
no matter our technological capabilities. The Court was no doubt working from at least an implicit
understanding that the biological facts of the developing embryo are important, and the capacity to
maintain one's existence as an independent organism is clearly important to human nature and
rights. But to then fixate on the narrow and technologically-bound idea of viability draws
attention away from the essential facts about the entity's nature that would give rise to
personhood.

So while viability is certainly necessary to personhood, it cannot be sufficient and is not
fundamental.

### Birth

Many instead uphold birth as that critical point of personhood. Before birth, the fetus is
contained within, attached to, and utterly dependent upon the mother for life support.<sup>7</sup>
After birth, the baby is separate and unattached, it (typically) has no reliance on life support
because it is now using its own lungs and digestive system for air and nutrition, and while still
quite needy it can be cared for by someone other than the mother.<sup>8</sup>

Notice first that while quite dramatic and important, this event does not itself constitute a
metaphysically significant change in the basic nature of the organism. That successful births
happen over a range of days is testament to the fact that the fetus is not suddenly transformed
into something altogether biologically new with different capacities. Rather, being born means
adjusting whether and how its *existing* faculties are used. For example, once outside the mother
there are significant adjustments in how a human being's circulatory system is routed as it begins
using its own lungs to breathe.<sup>9</sup> Being born means a change in location and operation,
not any change in basic nature.

Birth also marks the end of a profound and intimate relationship of dependence on the mother. But
note that this is primarily a change in degree and form of dependence, as newborns cannot survive
without the right attention. So this cannot itself constitute a change in basic nature either. In
fact, a relationship of utter dependence arriving or vanishing altogether is not determinate of any
change in our basic nature, which is why being in a coma or attached to a life-support system are
not *in themselves* relevant to the existence of rights. Consider the traffic accident victim in
the hospital whose rights are uniformly and continuously recognized before, during, and after
reliance on life support.

And as with the case of viability, instructive absurdities arise with the prospect of future
technology replacing womb altogether: with no "birth" other than an owner deciding at some time to
separate the entity from life support technology, this position would allow for denying rights in a
fully-grown adult even as he demands to be released. This again indicates that something is deeply
wrong in this criterion. In fixating on the event of birth with its *relational changes* of a
physical separation from and shift in level of dependence on the mother, advocates of this position
appear to have likewise lost sight of the fact that rights flow from the fundamental nature of the
entity itself. Indeed, this very fact is flatly denied in maintaining that rights appear with
birth: an induced or cesarean delivery on Monday would mean full recognition of a person with
rights who cannot be morally or legally killed Tuesday --- yet a late-term abortion scheduled for
that Tuesday would mean killing the very same entity without any rights violation whatever.

Advocates of this position are correct to focus on the capacity for biological independence as
important to personhood, and that capacity is clearly demonstrated in birth, so birth is certainly
sufficient for personhood. But the event itself is not fundamental. Rather than wrongly focusing on
shifting relationships to mother --- or on shifting capabilities due to technology, as with
viability --- we must keep our attention squarely focused on the developing nature of the entity
itself to determine whether and when it has rights.

### Maturity

To round out our tour of criteria, note the uncontroversial point that we do recognize rights in
fully-developed and -functioning human beings --- that indeed, this is at the very heart of what
rights are for. It is most obvious at maturity that humans require freedom to identify and pursue
the values necessary to sustain their lives.<sup>10</sup>

The fact to highlight here is how being fully-developed and -functioning is likewise not a
criterion for personhood: We recognize and protect rights in those who are *not* functioning humans
currently exercising their distinctively human faculties; people do not lose their fundamental
rights by merely becoming unconscious, disabled, or profoundly dependent as in the life-support
example above. And similarly, we recognize the basic rights of those whose faculties are *not fully
developed*. Waiting for full development before recognizing rights would mean that newborn babies
must be excluded from recognition as people because many of their distinctively human faculties are
not yet fully present, specifically neural ones (synapses "start forming during week 17 [of
pregnancy] and multiply rapidly around week 28, continuing at a rapid pace up until 3--4 months
after birth"<sup>11</sup>). More to the issue, even young children would be excluded from
recognition as they have not yet developed the most important and distinctively human faculty of
all, the one that makes rights both possible and necessary in the first place: *rationality*, the
basic tool of human survival.<sup>12</sup> Our capacity for conceptual cognition and moral agency
(volition) does not arrive until years after birth.<sup>13</sup>

So being fully developed and fully functioning are not necessary for personhood. Before turning to
what *is* required, we need to first clarify the relationship of rights and obligations.

### Rights and Obligations

Rights are a recognition of peoples' individual sovereignty and the fundamental harmony of
interests that exists among rational agents. They codify the fact that we humans can and should
live together in a non-sacrificial manner with no masters and no slaves --- that we have absolutely
no unchosen duty to serve as the means to others' pursuit of life and happiness. Respecting rights
demands the negative obligation of refraining from coercive interference in others' pursuit of life
and happiness.<sup>14</sup> So a valid account of rights and abortion cannot posit *unchosen*
positive obligations or duties for anyone, to anyone --- whether the parties are adult, child, or
unborn.

That is, all positive obligations arise by choice in a rights-respecting society. We are not
sacrificial animals; socially, we are best characterized as *contractual* animals with the capacity
for living productively by reason and dealing with others by persuasion and trade. Thus we can and
routinely do choose to accept obligations to others in the course of pursuing the tremendous values
possible to those living in a proper, rights-respecting society.<sup>15</sup> It is important to
note that undertaking obligations does not mean any limitation or ceding of one's inalienable
rights; indeed, adopting positive obligations is an expression and affirmation of rights. And one
can violate another's rights by *failing* in one's (necessarily voluntary) positive obligations.

Consider that people can *explicitly* adopt responsibility for helping others, as with police and
firefighters: in a free society of course these people have no automatic duty to protect or rescue
anyone. But once they agree to do so, it becomes a rights violation to then arbitrarily withhold
protection and rescue efforts as needed to their clients. (Unless doing their jobs would mean
sacrificing their own lives, of course. While accepting such a job could entail agreeing to engage
in extraordinarily risky activity, it cannot require outright suicide.)

And people can also *implicitly* adopt responsibility for caring for others: If Bob decides to take
Mary for a ride out to sea, he does not have the right to then order her off his boat to her
death.<sup>16</sup> That would be murder because Bob chose to bring Mary --- another person ---
into a state of vital dependence on him. Mary's rights would be violated by then arbitrarily
removing his support and thrusting her into mortal danger rather than delivering her safely from
the dependent condition he created. (And note that such withdrawal of support would be a rights
violation no matter whether she was threatened by his explicit design, depraved indifference, or
mere recklessness.) Bob is responsible for Mary's welfare until the dependence he invited has
ended.

This provides a key principle for navigating the tangle of abortion rights and parental
obligations.

### Fetal Rights and Maternal Obligations

Recall that rights are rooted in the essential nature of the entity itself, that there is no
metaphysically-significant change in the nature of the newborn at birth, and that we recognize its
basic human rights at every point thereafter. This indicates that the point of personhood is
reached some time *before* birth. But does this introduce an inherent clash of rights between
mother and fetus? Are we faced with any call to compromise, "balance," or "trade off" rights
between them? No. On this account, all people retain *all* of their rights, completely intact. A
mother can have no duties or claims forced upon her in a rights-respecting society; people can only
be bound by obligations they choose to create.

The principle from the boat ride identifies how *maternal obligations arise as fetal rights
obtain*: in choosing to let her pregnancy proceed to the point of personhood, the mother thereby
adopts responsibility for the person she brings into a condition of vital dependence. Like the boat
captain, she is not free to then arbitrarily kill or neglect her charge; that would be a clear
violation of a person's rights. She has chosen to shoulder the responsibility of supporting the
fetus to independence, and this is a serious obligation she can and should be held to.<sup>17</sup>

Nonetheless, as with the case of firefighters and police, even an obligation this serious and
risk-laden cannot demand suicide. The right to self-defense must be recognized for a mother whose
life is threatened by a developing fetus. And it is important to see that such a circumstance is
not unique to pregnancy: this is no different in principle from a boat passenger turning into a
mortal threat to the captain, whether by purposeful design or random disease. The captain has the
right to self-defense and may rightly eliminate the threat which came to him.

In general, every mortal clash between an unborn person and its mother must be approached in the
same manner we approach *any* such conflict involving people and their rights: under the banner
of the government's legal system. Its purpose is to resolve the endless challenging questions
around just what constitutes a rights violation or threat, and just what is and is not a
permissible response to such --- all by reference to broad legal principles that address much more
than pregnancy and childbirth.<sup>18</sup>

### Reproductive Rights and Parental Obligations

Now recall that the point of personhood must be some time *after* fertilization. This means that
requiring a woman to carry a fertilized egg to term in a misguided effort to protect its
nonexistent "right to life" would be a gross violation of *her* rights, imposing bodily risk and a
substantial, perhaps even crushing burden on her life.<sup>19</sup> A pregnant woman must be left
entirely free --- as a matter of right --- to consider and choose whether to continue or terminate
her pregnancy; until the embryo reaches the point of personhood her actions cannot constitute a
rights violation, and she can have no legal obligations regarding it.

This is the window in which the woman should work with the man to establish his parental
obligations, if any, and this is accomplished by a natural application of basic rights and
contract: If she desires parenthood but he signals he does not, she is still free to continue with
the pregnancy and assume the attendant obligations alone --- for she has no right to hold him to a
parental commitment he did not accept. If he desires parenthood but she does not, she is
nonetheless free to take steps to end the pregnancy --- for he has no right to hold her to a
parental commitment she does not accept. If both desire parenthood, they can and should establish a
contract to that effect so she can allow the pregnancy to proceed to personhood, secure in the
knowledge that their shared parental obligations are established and can be enforced.<sup>20</sup>

Lives are complicated affairs and there is of course no end of difficult cases and circumstances to
be dealt with. The point is not to detail them here, but to indicate how this approach allows them
to be addressed in a fully rights-respecting way by application of the same mechanisms and broad
principles used in the rest of life and law.

### Attaining Personhood

Finally turning to personhood itself, recall that a human being need not be fully developed to be a
person (indeed, it cannot be fully developed while in the womb). Nonetheless, a person must
necessarily be an actual human being and not a mere potential. The point we seek to identify is
where the entity becomes an *essentially formed human being* --- a living human organism with
essential organs and a nervous system, operating at least at some basic level to maintain its own
existence *as* an organism.<sup>21</sup> This captures the basis of the capacity for biological
independence explicitly demonstrated in birth, and names what is implicitly recognized in the idea
of viability when it is not bound tightly to technology. Importantly, this keeps our attention
where it belongs: on the basic nature of the developing entity.

A glance at prenatal development makes it clear that this point cannot be in the first trimester,
because the embryonic stages of development conclude only as "All essential organs have at least
begun formation."<sup>22</sup> Indeed, early on, human embryos are largely indistinguishable from
those of other mammals, with higher evolutionary features appearing later (like the cerebrum, the
most sophisticated part of our brain, which develops last).<sup>23</sup> Later, in the fetal stages
of development, weeks 25--28 feature rapid brain growth and the nervous system finally developing
enough to control some body functions. At this point the respiratory system, while still immature,
has also developed to the point where gas exchange is possible.<sup>24</sup> So the developmental
point of personhood appears to be near the beginning of the third trimester, and this point's
candidacy is perhaps urged by the still later appearance in week 31 of "Thalamic brain connections,
which mediate sensory input [and] form."<sup>25</sup> Of course this is only a layman's estimate;
determining just when this stage of development is attained is a biological question that must be
answered by scientists, not by philosophers.<sup>26</sup>

It is interesting that, if the start of the third trimester indeed marks the developmental point
for attainment of personhood, this would result in my arguing for an outcome which roughly agrees
with the Supreme Court's 1973 *Roe v. Wade* bottom line that a woman may abort her pregnancy for
any reason until the fetus reaches viability (which the Court took to be at about seven months or
28 weeks), while abortion after viability must be available when needed to protect the woman's life
or health.<sup>27</sup> Unfortunately as explained above, the point the Court argued for was
characterized using the technologically-bound concept of viability, thus clouding the essential
issue of personhood. And their position was based on a "right to privacy" and entailed a balancing
of rights against "state interests" rather than being an expression and defense of basic human
rights as inalienable absolutes.<sup>28</sup> This has confused the discussion of rights and
obligations, and hobbled our legal system's pursuit of just and uniform treatment of the myriad
issues around and beyond pregnancy and parenthood.

### Conclusion

Prior to the point of being an essentially formed human being --- of actually *being* a human being
--- an embryo can have no rights to be recognized or violated. So the pregnant woman must be left
legally free as a matter of right to choose whether to carry an embryo to the point of personhood.
After that point, the fetus is a human being with the attendant basic human rights, and these must
be safeguarded in a rights-respecting society. This entails no clash or compromise of rights
because parental obligations arise as fetal rights obtain: in choosing to bring another person into
a condition of vital dependence on her, a mother elects to shoulder the responsibility of
(non-suicidally) supporting that person to independence --- a responsibility to which the father
can likewise elect to be bound via contract.

Thus we have an integrated approach to fetal rights, reproductive rights, maternal obligation, and
parental obligation. Importantly, this is an account that demands full and consistent recognition
of the basic human rights of all as absolutes, never to be compromised or abridged.

15. Even (legitimate) obligations we associate with accident have a critical dependence on choice.
    For example, the obligation to pay for damage in a car accident flows from being *responsible*
    for the harm; we identify it as essentially a product of chosen actions like recklessness, as
    opposed to unchosen actions which would render the actor blameless (like those resulting from,
    say, a brain aneurysm).
16. Only the analysis around this boat-ride parallel is mine --- I think I first heard the analogy
    used by Diana Hsieh in a conversation many years ago.
17. This also clarifies the source of the essential mission of parenthood: raising a child to full
    independence --- i.e., to a person capable of living by our species' distinctive means of
    survival (conceptual thought, rationality), pursuing and producing the values needed to survive
    and flourish as a human. Additionally, it highlights the basis of and basic standard for any
    government intervention in the rearing of children: a parent sabotaging the ability of a child
    to ever achieve such independence.
18. In a proper, rights-respecting society, one delegates the use of force, placing it under the
    objective processes and instruments of the government. Even in the case of an emergency where
    there is no time for the government to deal with an immediate threat (like fending off a mugger
    with deadly force, or an emergency late-term abortion), one must justify the use of force
    against a person after the fact and face criminal punishment if it was not warranted. See Ayn
    Rand, "The Nature of Government" in *The Virtue of Selfishness* (Signet 1964). Essay also

21. I owe the basic idea of "essentially formed" here to Dr. Leonard Peikoff. In a lecture coupled
    with the publication of his book *Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand*, he was asked about
    when a potential human being becomes an actual human being and briefly discussed a point like
    this before birth. [Leonard Peikoff, 1991--1992, "Advanced Seminars on *Objectivism: The
    Philosophy of Ayn Rand*," Lecture 14 Disk 1, 34:00. See a transcript [here](abortion-faq).]

26. Relying on the division of intellectual labor to identify, with ever greater precision as
    science progresses, when a fetus becomes a person by the standard of an "essentially formed
    human being" does not flirt with the mistake we saw earlier regarding viability. That position
    defined the standard *itself* as something inessential that shifts with progress in technology,

    to protect the woman's life, the Court indicates that it does not in fact regard this as
    marking the appearance of absolute rights which must be recognized and defended.
