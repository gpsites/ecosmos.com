### Is quantum physics compatible with reason and Objectivism?

Why or why not?

* Objectivist Answers question by Cherman on October 5, 2010

### Answer

	
Quantum physics is a legitimate field of study and as such it is reliant on reason (and of course compatible with Objectivism). 
The domain seems quite strange and counterintuitive, but new and strange phenomena don't conflict with reason per se -- 
everything we now rationally understand started out as new and strange, after all.

We need to distinguish between quantum fact and quantum interpretation. 
The quantum facts seen in experiment are solid and not in dispute. 
However, the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum fact (currently quite fashionable) 
is the source of what I suspect you are asking about: the widespread notion that 
quantum scientists have demonstrated that things in the world are somehow radically 
dependent upon consciousness for their identities and very existence 
(that an "observation" will "collapse the wave function," to use their lingo, 
transforming some patch of existence from an indeterminate statistical fog into something concrete and determinate). 
Or that reality is inherently contradictory (an implication drawn from "wave-particle duality" and other quantum phenomena) -- 
or that causality doesn't hold or can work in reverse, etc. 
These ideas would certainly be in conflict with Objectivism, but Objectivists brush them aside as mistakes 
(mistakes that can be reliably identified by non-physicists, much like a non-lawyer can reliably identify 
a bad legal argument if it involves a logical fallacy). The Copenhagen interpretation is only 
an expression of bad philosophy masquerading as science.

The key to seeing this lies in understanding how science as a discipline is an outgrowth of and utterly dependent 
on a certain metaphysics -- one which at least implicitly recognizes the philosophical [axioms](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/axioms.html) Rand explicitly 
identified as Existence, Identity (including Causality), Consciousness, and the essential relationship they 
entail of the [primacy of existence over consciousness](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/primacy_of_existence_vs_primacy_of_consciousness.html) (i.e., consciousness as fundamentally the grasp of facts, 
not the creation or shaping of them). When someone cites scientific results as overturning philosophical axioms, 
he is engaging in a logical fallacy called "[concept stealing](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/stolen_concept,_fallacy_of.html)" and inverting the relationship between philosophy 
and science. You can observe the symptoms in how the scientists who think that the Copenhagen interpretation 
follows from their work are essentially saying that they have identified facts which violate identity; 
that they have observed the effects of experiments which invalidate causality; 
and that they have studied the facts of existence and grasped the (mind-independent) fact that facts are are created by consciousness. 
Notice the consistent pattern of relying on what is being questioned or denied.

Objectivists are of course not threatened by this kind of confusion. 
Indeed, in clarifying the basic relationship between philosophy and the special sciences, 
Objectivism provides a powerful tonic against unproductive blind alleys like the 
Copenhagen interpretation of QM, even putting scientists in a better position to do great science.
